CHE477 Markov Chain - Monte Carlo Project

Markov Chain Monte Carlo is an effective statistical tool. Using
 Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, this program aims to model some fundamental
 attributes for Marko Chain Monte Carlo simulations.

 Primarily:

 Give examples of the top 1% most probable graphs under the stationary
 distribution

 What is the expected number of edges connected to vertex 0.

 What is the expected number of edges in the entire graph.

 What is the expected maximum distance of the shortest path in a graph that
 connects vertex 0 to another vertex.
